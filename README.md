# Trading game

## Local Development Mode

To successfully run this app you would need to:

1. Install the required node packages - `npm install`
2. Start the project in local development mode - `npm start`

It is a good idea to re-run those commands when pulling updated code.

It is *NOT necessary* to run the build command `npm run build` when running the app for the first time.

## Production

1. Build the project projects - `npm run build`
2. Serve the content of `build/www/trading-game` using any webserver.
